## Gameplay
### Mechanics
The object of the game is to get as high a score as possible by lassoing as many cows as possible. The game ends if 2 cows pass the player or the player hits 3 obstacles.

* Player is on the left side of the screen, and can only move up or down.
* Player shoots lasso to try and hit a cow.
* Successful lasso adds a point to the player's score.
* If 2 cows pass the player, it's game over.
* If the player hits the cow with his horse, the cow will run back to the right side of the screen.
* Obstacles will randomly appear from the right side of the screen. Hitting obstacles 3x will end the game.

### Control
#### Keyboard
**W, S** to move the cowboy up and down the screen.

**SPACEBAR** to Launch Lasso.
### Teaching
The game will have a splash screen with basic instructions for playing the game.

### Player Learning
A trick in the game is to keep the cows on the screen. The best way is to hit them with your horse to cause them to run back to the right.
